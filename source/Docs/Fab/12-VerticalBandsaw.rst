    (Mark at two places at the far edges)

    b. Then, connect the two dots (geometry!!!) to form a line

2. Set up the “guiding fence” and the Table

    a. Adjust the fence to the desired cutting width, ensuring it is parallel to the blade

        i. Pro tip: use a straight side

    b. Set the table height to match the material thickness for a stable and accurate cut

    b. Align the saw with the line 

    c. Turn on the machine by pressing the green switch (located around your waist lvl)

    d. Hold the material firmly against the fence and table while keeping your hands a safe distance away from the blade

        i. Pro tip: Grab a wooden block to assist you with feeding the material
