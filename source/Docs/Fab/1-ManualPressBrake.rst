.. attention::

    **WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES** when using the machine. 

.. note::

    You can only bend **steel**. If you try to bend aluminum, it will break. 

Instructions
************

1. Make sure that the blade is aligned with the long, rectangular indent

    a. Turn the **red wheel** CLOCKWISE. You will notice that the blade travels downwards

    b. Once it is close to the hole (make sure to leave a small gap!), move *the block with the indent in it* so that it is **parallel** to the blade. This ensures that the bend will be parallel to the hole

2. Align the part you want to be bent **under** where the blade will come down, in the small gap you made

    a. The part will be bent under the blade, so make sure that the area you want to be bent is **directly underneath** the edge of the blade in the correct orientation

3. Turn the pressure OFF

    a. To do this, rotate the *black* knob above the gauge CLOCKWISE, in the direction that the arrow that says CLOSE points

4. Once the knob stops turning, the pressure is OFF

5. Take the *top* bar from the space directly under the gauge

6. Insert the bar into the black hole between the pressure gauge and spring

.. caution:: 

    Make sure that no one is touching the area where the press will come down!

7. Move the bar up and down to move the blade further downwards 

    a. Once the blade makes contact with the part, the blade may turn

.. caution::

    Make sure to re-align the part and rectangular block if needed

8. Continue moving the bar up and down until it is very difficult to move

    a. The pressure gauge should read around 100 at this point

9. Remove the bar and place it back on the rack

10. Slowly release the pressure by rotating the black knob above the gauge COUNTERCLOCKWISE

.. caution::

    Make sure that no one is near the blade as it will pop up

11. Remove the part from the bending press

12. ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!
