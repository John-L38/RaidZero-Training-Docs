    **WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES** when using the machine. 

Instructions
************

Part 1: Marking the Spots to Drill
==================================

1. When drilling, you should always know exactly where and how wide you want to drill your box channel/object. 

.. note::

    Normally you would use the **Omio** to “tap” or mark the spots to drill. This is because the Omio is a lot 
    more precise and thus your holes will be aligned. However, in the case that your box channel/object cannot 
    fit in the Omio, you will have to **hand mark** spots on your box channel/object. 

2. Mark the spots with a **hole puncher**:

        :scale: 30%
    
    b. Mark the spot by using a pen/marker. 

    c. Secure the box channel and press down hard on the hole puncher. 

    .. caution:: 

        There will and should be a loud popping sound as well as a vibration from the hole punch. 

Part 2: Switching the Drill Bit
===============================

1. You must switch the drill bit on the drill to the size that creates the hole you want (e.g. 5.0mm vs 3.4mm). 

    a. Find the correct size drill bit in the **drill bit rack** (numbers are marked on the rack from 1.0mm-12.9mm). 

    b. .. image:: ../Photos/DrillPress/Drill_Bit_Rack.png

2. When switching the drill bit, you must use the correct **tightening/loosening tool** (there are many 
   different sizes for different drills): 

    a. .. image:: ../Photos/DrillPress/Bit_Tool.png
        :scale: 30%
    
    b. By matching the grooves on the tool to the drill, lock the tool in place and turn 

    .. tip:: 
    
        Turn counter-clockwise to loosen and vice versa (“lefty loosey righty tighty”). 

    c. As you turn, the drill will begin to fall, so be ready to catch it as it slides out. 

    .. caution:: 

        Dropping drill bits can chip and **break** them. 

    d. Put the drill bit you want into the slot in the drill and use the tool again to 
       tighten the drill (turn clockwise to tighten.)

    .. caution::

        Make sure the drill bit is centered in the slot or else as you tighten the drill the drill bit will be slanted.
        If drill bits are not tightened, they might **fall off** while drilling which is dangerous. 

3. **IMPORTANT: PUT THE DRILL BIT YOU DON’T WANT BACK ON THE RACK.**

    a. Find out the size of the drill bit and put it back in its corresponding slot (the size of 
       the drill bit is normally written in white at the end)

    .. tip::

        Use a caliper if the writing has faded out.

    .. important:: 

        Forgetting to put drill bits back is how we lose specific sizes. 

Part 3: Drilling
================

1. Align your marked hole to the drill bit: 

    a. .. image:: ../Photos/DrillPress/Align.png
        :scale: 30%

    b. Lower the drill bit using the three-pronged handle on the side and match the center of the drill 
       bit to the center of your marked hole. Slightly push down on the box channel with the drill to 
       make sure the placement is correct. **Always do this step before drilling and when the DRILL IS OFF. **

    .. tip::

        **Use the clamp to secure the box channel.**

        .. image:: ../Photos/DrillPress/Clamp.png
            :scale: 30%

        By using a clamp, the drilling process will be a lot more **accurate** and **safe**. This is **highly 
        recommended** but optional if you are under time constraints or you are just making a prototype (*however 
        proper building should be present even when making prototypes*). 

    c. Adjust clamp to fit the box channel and lock the box channel tight. Turn counter clockwise to 
       loosen and vice versa to tighten. 

2. Turning on the drill: 

    a. .. image:: ../Photos/DrillPress/Turning_On.png
        :scale: 30%

    b. There are two buttons, the top black is to start it and the bottom red one is to stop

    c. Start the drill by pressing the black button

    .. caution:: 

        Never turn on the drill when it is touching the box channel. Always start the drill before you lower 
        it onto the box channel!

3. Lowering the drill

    a. Lower the drill **SLOWLY** and push all the way through: 

    .. caution:: 

        Drilling too fast can cause the drill bit to be damaged, the part to be damaged, and the drill bit to be 
        stuck. If the drill bit gets stuck, **turn the drill off immediately**!! Then, secure that part in place, 
        remove the drill bit, and reattach it (but tighter this time and please drill slower!!). 

    b. Once the drill bit passes completely through, raise the drill back up slowly. If you feel a lot of 
       resistance, you can try adding oil to the hole. 

.. tip::

    Use an **alternate** drilling method - Peck Drilling!

    - Peck Drilling is when you **don’t go all the way through** and lift up the drill **halfway/multiple times** 
      during the drilling process. 

    - Why Peck Drilling is better: 

        - It breaks up the chips (created by drilling) from long strands to short strands → less stress on the drill bit. 

        - It allows better heat transfer through excess material

        - Material is less likely to bend because you are no longer forcing through

        - Less blowout on the other side of the hole (bottom side).

4. Turning off the drill: 

    a. Press the red button. 

    b. Wait until the drill has stopped spinning and remove your part. 

Part 4: Etiquette
=================

1. It is good etiquette to remove your drill bit and put it back on the rack!

2. Clean residue from drilling if you have time. 

3. ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!!
