    **WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES** when using the machine. 

Instructions
************

1. Lift up the horizontal band saw to about 45 degrees (if it has not been lifted already). 

    a. There should be enough space to slide your box channel in comfortably between the clamps. 

.. important:: 

    Important: If the band saw starts falling immediately, turn the golden valve perpendicular to the black pneumatic pump. **Refer to step 4**
    
.. caution::    
    
    Caution: Moving the band saw up to high can cause it to get stuck. 

2. Load your box channel in between the clamp, adjusting the clamp using the wheel on the left side of the machine - tighten the clamp afterwards.

3. In front of the machine, you will see a black pneumatic pump - right beneath it, the golden part is what you will use.

    a. Gold valve  motion:
        
        i. Perpendicular = stop.
        
        ii. Parallel = move.
        
        iii. 45 degrees = I recommend when you want to move; parallel might be too fast so slowly turn the valve to figure out the speed.

4. The golden valve will be perpendicular to the golden pneumatic. Turn the golden valve parallel to the golden pneumatic.  : NOTICE HOW THE BLADE STARTS FALLING.
    a. If the blade is falling too fast — we want it to go SLOW:
       
        i. You can use the small white dial next to the golden valve (turn this) and change the speed of the blade falling down.
        
        ii. You can also move the valve to about 45 degree angle to slow down the speed of the blade that is falling. 
    
.. important:: 

    Important: You can always lift up the saw at any time if you feel like the blade is falling too fast and you need more time to adjust the speed. 

5. Right before  the blade is about to touch the box channel, turn the valve perpendicular to the pneumatic again and look from the top of the blade to align your cut (it should be directly on the part you want to cut).
    
    a. I like to give the cut more tolerance so that I can sand it later and make the cut more accurate. However,  notice how THIN the blade is and don’t give it too much room - sanding too much is not recommended…

6. Turn the valve to parallel angle (or you don’t need to make it fully parallel) and grip on the wheel - bring the saw up and put the valve perpendicular again to stop it

7. Liftthe saw slightly higher than  the box channel and tighten the box channel again. Now you are ready to cut

.. caution:: 
    
    Caution: Make sure you put eye protection on again… Safety!!

    b. A good rule of thumb as to how much coolant you should let through: when turning on the blade, let enough through that the coolant coats the blade but doesn’t fall off and spray everywhere (it should stick to the blade)

8. In between two red metal pieces, you will see a switch (connected to white part of the machine and NOT THE BLUE ONE) — flip this switch to start the saw

9. As the saw is running, slowly open the red valve to let coolant out - you want minimal amount just so that it cools the contact point and prevents the particles from flying

    a. Make sure that coolant is flowing through the blade - if not or if too much, adjust the valve

        i. If coolant doesn’t come out, PLEASE ASK!!

        ii. You don’t want to make a mess on the floor so a minimal amount of water is recommended.

10. As the blade is moving, turn the golden valve every so slightly to lower the blade. 

    a. Slower the better!!! You want the blade to come down VERY slowly, 

    .. caution:: 
       
       Caution: if you go fast, you will break the blade and potentially the machine… please make it go slow!!

    b. Take about 8 seconds for the blade to completely cut the box channel 

11. When the machine completes the cut, it will automatically stop operating.  

12. Put the saw up again, lock the saw with the golden valve,  loosen the clamp, take your box channel.
