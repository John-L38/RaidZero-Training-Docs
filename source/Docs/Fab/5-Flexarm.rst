Instructions
************

1. Clamp the part onto the vice

    a. Make sure the part is within armâ€™s reach

2. Change the drill bit on the flex arm

    a. Pull the top ring and bottom drill bit in different directions  

    b. Put the drill bit back on the rack

    c. Insert the drill bit back onto the arm

        .. caution::

            Caution: Double check to make sure you know the correct sized drill bit

        ii. Simply push it upwards and it should make a

5. Side button (silver) + black button = counterclockwise (reverse) 

6. Spin the drill bit forward (silver side button) and move the arm slowly toward the hole

    a. There should be some resistance when the drill bit contacts the hole

        .. caution::

            Caution: Do not force the drill bit down too hard; let the drill bit do its work

        ii. If the drill bit is not going downwards smoothly or is stuck in one place, immediately reverse the drill bit and pull it out

        iii. This means that the drill bit does not have enough torque to make it through the metal - Kindly ask Mr. Hsu or Ms. Kuo to increase the torque of the drill bit

        iv. Apply constant force to move the drill bit smoothly through the hole

7. Once the drill bit is through the other side, press the side button (silver) along with the black button to reverse it

    a. You should also apply some force upwards to pull the drill bit out of the hole
