Instructions
************

1. Check if the waterjet primary pump is on (located right next to the powdercoating room; wood block has either ON / OFF pointing towards you

    a. If it’s turned ON, check the secondary pump (located next to the primary pump and make sure that secondary pump pressure is greater than 180 rpm

        i. If secondary pump is on AND pressure gauge is greater than or equal to 40 rpm, you are all set!

        ii. If secondary pump is off, make sure that you turn it on after the pressure gauge is greater than or equal to 40 

    .. caution:: 
       
        Caution: If you turn the secondary pump on when pressure gauge is less  than 40 rpm, it’s going to break. PLEASE make sure that the gauge is over 40 rpm

    b. If it’s turned OFF, turn it ON and wait for the gauge in thesecondary pump to be greater than or equal to 40

    c. rpm

        i. Once it reaches 40 rpm, turn on the secondary pump and the pressure gauge should rise to about 180 rpm

2. If both pumps are ready, go to the computer, and open the .dxf file that you want to cut

    .. caution::

        Caution: click on the RED file as there might be blue files that won’t work on the waterjet

3. You’ll see a review screen, just click OK

4. You will be led to a OMAX LAYOUT WINDOW. Depending on how many of the parts that you wish to cut, adjust by functions on the left side of the screen, such as rotate, copy, move, etc

    .. caution:: 

        Caution: make sure that if you have multiple parts, they don’t overlap and you minimize the space in between them to save the material

5. On the right side of the screen, click Clean and click OK

    a. This allows the part to be ready for waterjet

6. On your keyboard, click S, A, Q, 3, S, and enter to set the quality of your piece to 3

    .. tip::
        
        Pro Tip: 5 has the best quality, but you go with 3 because better the quality, the longer it takes. Most of the parts would be quality 3

7. On the left side of the screen, select Autopath

    a. You will notice that the green lines connect some parts of the purple outline. This generates the path of the nozzle automatically

8. On the right side of the screen, select Post and click OK

    a. In the Post window, you can check whether the cut you want to make is proper. 

    b. When you are led to a new window, click path start

        i. Click somewhere around the beginning of the path, or the cross is located

9. Go to OMAX MAKE - Alt + Tab to find this window

10. Click Change Path Setup 

11. Browse the file that you just made in OMAX LAYOUT and check the drawing

12. Change the material 

    a. Alumium: Aluminum 6061

    b. Field Wood Parts: Red Oak / Hardwood

    c. Steel: Steel 

    d. Polycarb: Polycarbonate

13. Input the thickness: enter in inches (use caliper to convert)

    .. caution::

    1. Caution: DO NOT input the exact thickness, you need some TOLERANCE!! This means that you need to add an extra thickness so that the waterjet cuts through the material and it doesn’t just skim the surface
    
    2. e.g. if you are cutting 1/16 aluminum, 1/16 in = 1.5875 mm so Input 2 mm!

14. Place the material from the rack - use a caliper to check the thickness

    a. Thickness should be a little bigger than the written thickness

15. Put the sheet on the corner, and place some weights on the parts that you are not cutting so that the parts don’t fly out during the cut 

    a. If the nozzle is on your way, adjust the location of the nozzle


Nozzle Movement Keys:

    - X and Y direction (horizontal and vertical movement along a plane)
        
        Use arrow keys (arrow key + SHIFT speeds things up)

    - Z direction (up and down height)

        Use keys 1 and 7 on the number pad

16. Go to the location where your path start is located by moving the nozzle

17. On top right of the screen, you will see two sets of coordinates. Press zero to the second set of coordinates, which will zero the path start. Click OK

18. Adjust the z height so that the nozzle is about a finger thickness away from the plate

    .. caution::

        Extra cation: don’t move the nozzle when your finger is under the nozzle, you are going to lose your finger. Make sure that no one else but you are controlling the nozzle and after small moves fit your finger under the nozzle to check if it has a tight fit
        
        DO NOT MOVE WHEN YOUR FINGER IS IN BETWEEN THE PLATE AND THE NOZZLE!!! PLEASE!!!

19. Right click (not left) on the Begin Machining 

20. Click Spot on Path and pick the farthest edge by moving your cursor

    a. This will move the nozzle to the location you want to go. Doesn’t have to be the farthest edge, but go to spot where you think there is not enough space. Make sure that your nozzle does not run over an empty part, it has to have a solid part where u can cut

    .. caution::

        Caution: DO NOT have any weights on the way of the nozzle, it’s going to stop if it runs into the steel block while moving

21. When system says, “machine will now transverse into the location”, click OK and check that the nozzle moves to the correct location

22. On the top right of the screen where you zeroed a few steps ago, click go home 

    a. Make sure you don’t click go home on the first set of coords, you only need to use the go home for the second set of coordinates

    b. Machine will now transverse to home that you set

23. Now, you are ready to go!!! Before you do anything though, check:

    a. You are wearing safety goggles and ear protection

    b. No one is near the machine and they are aware that you are running the waterjet

    c. Double check your pumps are on and the umbrella-looking rubber piece is attached to the nozzle. This prevents water from splashing everywhere

24. GOOO!! Click Begin Machining and click Start

25. You can stop anytime using the stop button and if you are cutting multiple parts, it’s sometimes good to stop the machine and pick up the part that is already cut, and resuming the cut

    .. caution::

        Caution: ALWAYS! ALWAYS there should be a person or two standing by the machine to check that everything is fine. 

26. If you run into a problem, don’t hesitate to ask any of the heads or teachers or any adults standing around. It’s fine if something goes wrong, but please notify people ASAP

27. After the waterjet (when the progress bar reaches 100%) take out the parts that is cut and wash it off using the water gun and dry it using the air gun 

    a. Remove the plate for next user, or you can just leave it too

28. AGAIN, ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!!
