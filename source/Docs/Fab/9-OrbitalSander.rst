Instructions
************

For Belt and Disc Sander:

1. Turn  on the sander through the control button on the lower right end of the machine

    a. Hit the big RED emergency button to turn off the sander in the case of an emergency 

    b. Turn off the sander by hitting the same switch you used to turn it on

2. Put your part WITH the flow of the sander.

    a. For the belt sander, this means putting your part facing AWAY from the direction the grain is coming from. You do not want your part and the direction of the grain to be head on.

        i. Hold your part against the black thing over the belt.

        ii. If you don’t, the part might fly away, and it will damage the part

        .. tip:: 

            Pro tip: The belt sander is used for edges, not flat surfaces

    b. For the disc sander, this means putting your part in the center of the block, or the left side of the disc part. You want the grain to be coming down INTO the part, holding it against the block.

        i. If you don’t, the part might fly away, and it will be damaging to the part

        ii. Make sure to not apply too much pressure when sanding, excessive pressure can damage the material or overheat the sander

        .. caution:: 

            DO NOT WEAR GLOVES, if you do, your glove may get caught and drag your hand into the machine.

3. Start sanding!

4. ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!!

How to Use an Orbital Sander:

1. Wear safety goggles

    a. Some people may prefer wearing noise canceling earmuffs (it is a little loud)

2. Selecting your sandpaper

    a. Depending on what finish you’re looking for choose the appropriate grit sandpaper for your project

    b. The sandpaper can be found in the black cabinets along the stairs on the side closer to the windows and bays

    .. tip::

        Pro tip: If you are sanding wood and there is a lot of it, cut it with the vertical bandsaw or miter saw as it will create large amounts of dust that can be breathed in

3. Connect the sander to the air hose 

    a. If you think you need help, no you don’t!! Just push harder until you hear the click

    b. When connecting the two KEEP FINGERS CLEAR  of the sandpaper or the spinning portion of the sander as you can accidentally start the sander as it connects

4. Ensure your material is on a flat surface

5. Start Sanding!!!

    a. Keeping your fingers clear, hold on to the main circular part of the sander

    b. Start the sander by applying moderate pressure with your palm onto the push switch 

    c. Move the sander in a back-and-forth or circular motion, evenly distributing the sanding action.

    .. caution::

        Caution: AVOID TILTING THE SANDER 

6. After sanding, make sure to clean up whatever debris or dust created with the vacuum 

7. ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS!!!!
